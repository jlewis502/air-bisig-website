# Air Bisig Partnership Research & Strategy
*Research conducted: September 2025*

## Executive Summary

Air Bisig currently promises "comprehensive reporting" and "detailed analysis" on the inspections page, but lacks the certified expertise to deliver technical assessments. **Partnership model recommended** to provide complete inspection services while leveraging Air Bisig's aerial documentation strengths.

## Current Site Issues Identified

**Problematic Language on Website:**
- "Comprehensive reporting included"
- "Detailed report with findings, recommendations"  
- "Comprehensive reports for informed decision-making"
- "Detailed written report"

**Problem:** These promise technical analysis/professional judgment that Air Bisig may not be qualified to provide independently.

## Partnership Strategy Overview

### Core Concept
**Air Bisig's Role:** Professional aerial documentation, legal-grade imagery, notarized certifications
**Partner's Role:** Technical analysis, professional reporting, regulatory compliance
**Combined Value:** Complete inspection service with regulatory compliance
